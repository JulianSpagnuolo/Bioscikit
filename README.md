# Bioscikit
Collection of tools for calculations in life science labs.


The package is being developed with the intent that it be used for writing/creating electronic lab-books for "wet-bench" and "dry-bench" experiments, thereby integrating both bioinformatics and traditional analysis methods into a central place.
